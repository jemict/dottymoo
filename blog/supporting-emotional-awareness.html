              Gentle, low-pressure ways to help children recognise and talk about feelings with confidence.
            </p>

            <p>
              Understanding and talking about feelings can be challenging for many children.
              Emotional awareness develops gradually, and for some children it needs to be supported in a concrete and reassuring way.
            </p>

            <p>
              Children often find it easier to explore emotions when there is less direct pressure.
              Quiet moments, shared play and familiar comfort objects can provide a safe starting point for conversation.
            </p>

            <h2>Creating space for emotional conversations</h2>

            <p>
              Some children struggle to answer direct questions such as “How are you feeling?”
              They may not yet have the vocabulary or confidence to respond clearly.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sitting alongside a child during play, reading or bedtime routines can create a more relaxed setting.
              When conversation happens naturally, children are more likely to open up.
            </p>

            <h2>The role of comfort objects</h2>

            <p>
              A familiar teddy bear can act as a bridge during emotional conversations.
              Children often find it easier to talk about how their bear feels before talking about themselves.
            </p>

            <p>
              For example, asking “Do you think your bear feels worried today?” can feel much safer than asking the child directly.
              This gentle shift allows children to project feelings outward, making them easier to explore.
            </p>

            <h2>Building emotional vocabulary over time</h2>

            <p>
              Emotional awareness grows through repetition and reassurance.
              Naming feelings during everyday situations helps children connect words to experiences.
            </p>

            <p>
              Over time, children begin to recognise patterns in their emotions.
              This can lead to calmer communication and greater self-understanding.
            </p>

            <h2>Keeping support calm and predictable</h2>

            <p>
              Emotional support works best when it feels steady and predictable.
              Familiar routines, gentle tone and consistent reassurance help children feel secure.
            </p>

            <p>
              A personalised teddy bear can become part of that routine.
              Whether used during bedtime chats or quiet moments after a busy day,
              a comfort companion offers stability while emotions are being processed.
            </p>
