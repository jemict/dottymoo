            <p>
              As schools approach the final term of the academic year, attention naturally turns to end of year celebrations and recognising important milestones.
              Across the UK, leavers may be in Year 4 or Year 6 depending on the school structure. Wherever they are in their journey, completing this stage of education deserves to be marked.
            </p>

            <p>
              Personalised school leavers’ bears offer a thoughtful way to celebrate that achievement, giving pupils something tangible to take with them as they move forward.
            </p>

            <h2>Year 4 and Year 6: important transitions</h2>

            <h3>Year 4 leavers moving on to middle school</h3>
            <p>
              In areas with a three tier system, Year 4 can be a leavers’ year, with pupils transitioning to middle school.
              This step brings new routines, new friendships and often a larger school environment.
            </p>

            <p>
              A leavers’ bear can help mark the moment positively, providing a familiar reminder of the school community they have grown within.
            </p>

            <h3>Year 6 leavers moving on to secondary school</h3>
            <p>
              For many pupils, Year 6 marks the end of primary school and the beginning of secondary school.
              This transition can feel both exciting and daunting.
            </p>

            <p>
              A personalised keepsake becomes a quiet reminder of friendships, achievements and the place where part of their journey unfolded.
            </p>

            <h2>Ending the year on a celebratory note</h2>

            <p>
              The final term is about more than assemblies and presentations. It is a time to reflect on progress, resilience and growth.
              A personalised leavers’ bear symbolises shared memories and pride in how far pupils have come.
            </p>

            <h2>Recognising the whole school community</h2>

            <p>
              End of year celebrations are not only about pupils moving on. They are also a chance to recognise the staff who support children every single day.
            </p>

            <p>
              Teachers who work tirelessly throughout the year and often during the holidays.
              Teaching assistants who are worth their weight in gold.
              Office teams who keep communication flowing.
              Caretakers who ensure buildings are safe and welcoming.
              Kitchen staff who provide warm meals each day.
              Cleaners who work behind the scenes to keep classrooms ready for learning.
            </p>

            <p>
              A leavers’ bear printed with a school logo and year group wording can feel like a shared well done to the entire community.
              It represents collective effort, care and commitment across the whole school.
            </p>

            <h2>A keepsake that carries the journey forward</h2>

            <p>
              When pupils receive a leavers’ bear, it is not simply a gift.
              It reflects years of encouragement, guidance and shared experience.
              It honours the adults who supported them and the friendships that shaped them.
            </p>

            <p>
              As children move on to middle or secondary school, that familiar companion becomes a reminder of the place that helped them grow and of the community that believed in them from the beginning.
            </p>
