<p>
  Dotty Moo bears are designed as gentle keepsakes from meaningful moments and experiences.
  Each bear is personalised with your logo and colours, helping children take a small piece of the place or occasion home with them.
</p>

<p>
  We keep things simple and low risk. Most settings start with a single bear design, so you can see how it works before deciding whether to build from there.
</p>


          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>We create a sample.</strong>
              We prepare a draft design using your logo and colours, with the option of a sample bear.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>You choose how to trial it.</strong>
             Start with a small, sensible quantity and see how it works in your setting.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>We deliver to your venue.</strong>
              Bears arrive ready to display and share as a keepsake.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            There is no need to hold large stock or commit to a wide range.
            The focus is on fit, quality and a calm experience for your setting.
