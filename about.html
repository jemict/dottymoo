  <h1>About Dotty Moo</h1>

  <p>
    Dotty Moo is a family-run UK brand creating personalised bears and keepsakes for children, families, schools and organisations.
    Each bear is designed to celebrate meaningful moments, offer comfort, or mark a special occasion.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our direct-to-consumer range allows families to create a truly personal keepsake, with names, dates and short messages added to each bear.
    We keep the process clear and straightforward, with careful attention to presentation and quality.
  </p>

  <h2>Every name has a story</h2>
  <p>
    Dotty Moo began as a family nickname made up of “Dotty” and “Moo”, and grew into a brand inspired by childhood,
    connection and the small moments that matter.
  </p>
  <p>
    We believe a simple, well-made item can carry a lot of meaning, especially when it is made just for someone.
  </p>
