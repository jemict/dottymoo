        <h2>What this resource is</h2>
        <p>
          Dotty Moo Gets Ready for School is a gentle, printable social story created to help children understand
          and feel more confident about the steps involved in getting ready for school.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is designed to be read when a child is calm, not during a moment of distress, and can be revisited
          regularly as part of a familiar routine.
        </p>

        <h2>Who this may help</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Children who find mornings unpredictable or overwhelming</li>
          <li>Children who benefit from visual and consistent explanations</li>
          <li>Families looking for calm, low-pressure routine support</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How it is used</h2>
        <p>
          Many families find it helpful to read the story together at a calm time, such as the evening before
          school or during a quiet moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pages can be revisited individually, personalised to match what already works at home, or used alongside
          other visual routine supports.
