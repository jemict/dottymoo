          <h2>How they are used</h2>
          <p>
            Leaver bears are often given at the end of term, during leavers assemblies,
            or as a small gift from home to mark a big transition.
          </p>
          <p>
            They work equally well as individual gifts or as part of a coordinated school or class order.
