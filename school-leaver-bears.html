          <h2>What this is</h2>
          <p>
            School Leaver Bears are personalised soft toys created as a meaningful keepsake for children
            leaving a nursery, primary school, or other educational setting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each bear is designed to feel familiar, comforting, and special — something children can keep
            as they move on to their next stage.
          </p>

          <h2>How they are used</h2>
          <p>
            Leaver bears are often given at the end of term, during leavers assemblies,
            or as a small gift from home to mark a big transition.
          </p>
          <p>
            They work equally well as individual gifts or as part of a coordinated school or class order.
