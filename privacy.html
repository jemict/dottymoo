          <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
          <p class="lead">We take privacy seriously. This summary explains what we collect, why, and your choices. This is general guidance and not legal advice.</p>

          <h3>Who we are</h3>
          <p><strong>Dotty Moo Ltd</strong> (“we”, “us”) is a UK-based business providing keepsakes and related services, including products ordered through participating schools and personalised items ordered directly by customers.

          <p>We are registered with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). Registration number: ZC049916.</p>

          <h3>What we collect</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Order information (school orders)</strong> (via school specific Stripe checkout links or QR codes): details needed for fulfilment and distribution, such as pupil name, class or teacher, chosen product, and payment confirmation.</li>
            <li><strong>Order information (direct orders)</strong> (via Stripe checkout): customer name, delivery address, items purchased, personalisation details (for example, name to be printed, style choices and optional icon codes), and payment confirmation.</li>
            <li><strong>Contact information</strong> if you email us or contact us through the website.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical data</strong> (cookie preferences and, if you consent, analytics to help us improve the website).</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>How we use data</h3>

            <li>To process and fulfil orders (including printing personalisation and delivering to the relevant address or school)</li>
            <li>To provide support and respond to enquiries</li>
            <li>To improve our website and services</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Lawful bases</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Contract</strong> for orders placed through school order windows and for direct customer orders</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> for service improvement, preventing fraud, and basic website performance</li>
            <li><strong>Consent</strong> for non essential cookies (for example, analytics and marketing cookies) where required</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Sharing</h3>

            <li><strong>Delivery:</strong> delivery providers may receive your name, address, and contact details needed to deliver your order.</li>
            <li><strong>Schools:</strong> for school orders, we may share the order list and distribution details with the participating school so they can distribute items correctly.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We do not sell personal data.</p>

          <h3>Retention</h3>
          <p>We keep order and customer records only for as long as needed for fulfilment, customer service, accounting, and legal requirements. We then securely delete or anonymise information where appropriate.</p>
